# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
# Learn About Functional Programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

# Understand Functional Programming Terminology
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);

# Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function(tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

  // Only change code below this line

  const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.splice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
  const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.splice(1); // Get the tabs after the tab

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together

  // Only change code above this line

  return this;
 };

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);
